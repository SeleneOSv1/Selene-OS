# Legacy Archive Notes

This folder stores frozen historical snapshots for traceability.

Rules:
- Files under `docs/archive/` are non-canonical.
- They may contain retired names and pre-merge proposals.
- Do not use archive files as runtime, contract, or governance truth.
- Active truth lives in the canonical docs listed in `docs/00_INDEX.md`.
