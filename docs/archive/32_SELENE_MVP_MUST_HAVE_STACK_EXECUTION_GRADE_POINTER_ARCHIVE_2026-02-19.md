# 32_SELENE_MVP_MUST_HAVE_STACK_EXECUTION_GRADE (Legacy Archive Pointer)

## Status
- classification: legacy planning archive
- canonical: no
- sanitized_on: 2026-02-18
- reason: this file previously mixed historical proposals and retired engine naming that should not appear in active runtime/design references.

## What To Use Instead
Use these canonical sources for active design and implementation truth:
- `docs/00_DESIGN_TRUTH_OPTION_B.md`
- `docs/07_ENGINE_REGISTRY.md`
- `docs/06_ENGINE_MAP.md`
- `docs/COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/33_ENGINE_REVIEW_TRACKER.md`
- `docs/archive/34_ENGINE_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_PLAN_ARCHIVE_2026-02-19.md`

## Archive Location
- raw legacy snapshot: `docs/archive/32_SELENE_MVP_MUST_HAVE_STACK_EXECUTION_GRADE_LEGACY_2026-02-18.md`

## Guardrail
- This pointer file is the only active `docs/32...` surface.
- Legacy archive content is retained for historical traceability only and must not be used as runtime or contract authority.
