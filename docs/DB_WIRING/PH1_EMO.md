# PH1.EMO Namespace DB Wiring (Deprecated)

Status: deprecated namespace artifact retained only for historical traceability.

Rule:
- Do not use `PH1.EMO` as an active engine surface.
- Use only concrete engines:
  - `PH1.EMO.GUIDE` -> `docs/DB_WIRING/PH1_EMO_GUIDE.md`
  - `PH1.EMO.CORE` -> `docs/DB_WIRING/PH1_EMO_CORE.md`

Cleanup note:
- `PH1.EMO` was removed from active tracker/registry/map rows using the same cleanup pattern as `PH1.ACCESS`.
