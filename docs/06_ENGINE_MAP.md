# Engine Map (Navigation Only, Non-Canonical)

Purpose:
- Provide quick navigation to canonical engine/runtime docs.
- Do not store authoritative runtime policy, sequencing, or ownership truth here.

Non-canonical rule:
- This file is pointer-only.
- Canonical runtime and governance truth must live in the docs linked below.

## Canonical Control Docs

- Design truth and canonical ownership rules: `docs/00_DESIGN_TRUTH_OPTION_B.md`
- High-level law and policy pointers: `docs/05_OS_CONSTITUTION.md`
- Authoritative engine inventory + placements: `docs/07_ENGINE_REGISTRY.md`
- Simulation catalog (authoritative): `docs/08_SIMULATION_CATALOG.md`
- Blueprint registry (authoritative): `docs/09_BLUEPRINT_REGISTRY.md`
- DB ownership matrix (authoritative): `docs/10_DB_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md`
- Design lock status (authoritative): `docs/11_DESIGN_LOCK_SEQUENCE.md`
- Coverage/status matrix (authoritative): `docs/COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`

## Canonical Runtime Boundary Docs

- Top-level orchestration/runtime class boundaries:
  - `docs/DB_WIRING/PH1_OS.md`
  - `docs/ECM/PH1_OS.md`
- Engine-level runtime contracts:
  - `docs/DB_WIRING/*.md`
  - `docs/ECM/*.md`
- Kernel runtime envelopes:
  - `docs/04_KERNEL_CONTRACTS.md`

## Canonical Domain Navigation

- Blueprint process records: `docs/BLUEPRINTS/*.md`
- Memory architecture contract: `docs/12_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Engine closure execution plan (active): `docs/34_ENGINE_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
