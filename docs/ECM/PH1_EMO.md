# PH1.EMO Namespace ECM (Deprecated)

Status: deprecated namespace artifact retained only for historical traceability.

Rule:
- Do not route runtime calls through `PH1.EMO`.
- Use concrete engines only:
  - `PH1.EMO.GUIDE` -> `docs/ECM/PH1_EMO_GUIDE.md`
  - `PH1.EMO.CORE` -> `docs/ECM/PH1_EMO_CORE.md`

Cleanup note:
- `PH1.EMO` was removed from active tracker/registry/map rows using the same cleanup pattern as `PH1.ACCESS`.
