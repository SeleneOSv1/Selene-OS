## Issue
- I received these issues: PH1.FEEDBACK -> READ_ONLY_CLARIFY_LOOP (reason_code=1476395012).

## Fix
- This is the fix: apply recommendation `proposal_sig_1_PH1_FEEDBACK` to `PRUNE_CLARIFICATION_ORDERING`.
- Change class: CLASS-A. Proposal id: builder_prop_10106_20106_proposal_sig_1_PH1_FEEDBACK.
- Safety: keep gate order unchanged and require BLD-G1..BLD-G10 pass.
- Learning evidence attached: learn_report_builder_prop_10106_20106_proposal_sig_1_PH1_FEEDBACK (1 signals).

## Should I Proceed
- Should I proceed?

## Launch Question
- All tests passed. Can I launch?
